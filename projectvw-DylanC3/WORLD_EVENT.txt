1. how to trigger the event
- MouseClick
2. what should happen when the event is triggered
- triggers 9 nearby background tiles to turn into COVID animations -> a covid hotspot
3. what the affected entities should do
- miners turn green to indicate infected by COVID and are unable to move until a doctor is available
4. what the new entity is and how it should behave
- 2 doctors go around map looking for infected miners to vaccinate. Once within 1 tile, doctors vaccinate the miners,
  causing them to now be immune to the virus and protected from future COVID infections as well
5. the names of each partner and what each partner was responsible for
- Dylan Cho: Doctor entity + spawn on click, miner vaccination, miner transformation, debugging
- Angela Kim: InfectedMiner class and implementing mousePressed() method to trigger covid background tiles when
              mouse is clicked.
